# todo_list

I built this app to explore forms and user input in flutter. It's a simple to-do list which lists a bunch of different tasks with color coded priorities. You can add new tasks, specifying their title, description and priority, as well as remove them. The code is straightforward and helpful for any beginner Flutter programmer.
